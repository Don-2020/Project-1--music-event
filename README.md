SDS Events offers users to be able to search for music events in any location in the world. The user can connect to the Ticket Master website directly to the page of the selected event to view pricing, seating and to purchase tickets. 

Our team added the Google Maps API for the feature of searching for the events in areas as per the userâ€™s input. The Ticket Master API is added to display an image, artist name and event date and venue. The feature also offers a link to the purchasing tickets for the event.
